# Platzigram

[Platzigram](http://matteo.pythonanywhere.com/ "Platzigram") is a copy of Instagram used for learning the implementation and use of Django's authentication models and class-based views. 
I learned how to use and customize the Django auth models and the use of class-based views.
I created different settings with PostgreSQL for the development environment and MySQL settings for the deployment on pythonanywhere.com
